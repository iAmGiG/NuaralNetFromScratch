# Neural Network from Scratch

- With Chris.

## Description

This project is an implementation of a neural network from scratch. It's a reflection of my learning wrapped around the understand the fundamental concepts of neural networks without relying on any machine learning libraries, until we need them. NumPy and Pandas are far to crucial to not use today.

## Features

- uh, might look at expanding this to JS/TS or java/C++/C#.

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to install and setup your project. For example:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GIGA-Money/nuaralnetfromscratch.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nuaralnetfromscratch`
3. Install the required dependencies: `TBD`

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use your project. For example:

To train the neural network, run the following command:

```bash
